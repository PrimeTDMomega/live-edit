# Markdown Editor with Dark Mode/Light Mode Toggle

Welcome to the Markdown Editor with Dark Mode/Light Mode Toggle repository! This project provides a simple yet powerful Markdown editor with a real-time preview feature and the ability to switch between dark mode and light mode.

## Features

- **Split-Screen Layout:** The editor is split into two sections: the left side for typing Markdown content and the right side for previewing the rendered HTML output.

- **Real-Time Preview:** As you type Markdown content in the editor, the preview panel on the right updates in real time to show how the content will be rendered in HTML.

- **Dark Mode and Light Mode:** Toggle between dark mode and light mode with a single button located in the sidebar. The editor's appearance will change to match the selected mode, enhancing your writing experience.

- **Persistent Storage:** The Markdown content you've written will be saved in your browser's local storage, allowing you to continue your work even if you refresh the page or come back later.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/PrimeTDMomega/live-edit.git
2.  Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to launch the Markdown editor.
    
3.  In the editor, start typing your Markdown content on the left side. The preview on the right side will update in real time to show how the content will appear in HTML.
    
4.  Use the **Toggle Theme** button in the sidebar to switch between dark mode and light mode to suit your preference.
    
5.  Your Markdown content will be saved automatically, so you can continue your work even after closing the browser.
